# Ormless

Ormless is inspired by [Prisma2](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) and is built on a Typesafe SQL query builder called [Kysely](https://github.com/koskimas/kysely) that aims to add useful shortcut functions with no fuss and no surprises, fully and automatically typed.

Features:

- **A command-line tool introspect SQL database and generate the data schema for tables, views, constraints and enums**
- **Simple and fun way to select, insert, update and delete objects using the full power of SQL and Typescript**

\*\* This library is still work in progress and so does Kysely.
